# Qbitcraft

The goal behind Qbitcraft is to expand Minicraft+ and use it as a Java learning sample for aspiring coders.

Minicraft was originally made by Markus Perrson for ludum dare 22 competition.

Modded by David.b and +Dillyg10+ until 1.8, then taken over by Chris J until 2.0.4, then by afyber, and then by chrisj42.

This repo is forked from version [2.0.6 of chrisj42/minicraft-plus-revived](https://github.com/chrisj42/minicraft-plus-revived/releases/tag/v2.0.6) GitHub repo.

Qbitcraft version going forward with QbitUniverse will be 1.0.0.
