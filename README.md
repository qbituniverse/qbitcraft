# Qbitcraft

Qbitcraft goal is to expand Minicraft+ and use it as a Java learning sample for aspiring coders.

Modded by David.b and +Dillyg10+ until 1.8, then taken over by Chris J until 2.0.4, then by afyber, and then by chrisj42.

Minicraft was originally made by Markus Perrson for ludum dare 22 competition.
